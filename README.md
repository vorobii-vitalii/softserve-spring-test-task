# **Travel Agency Spring application**

Stack of technologies:
1. Spring Framework (Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Core, Spring Test)
2. Hibernate
3. MySQL
4. SLF4J
5. Templating engine - JSP/JSTL (+ Twitter Bootstrap library for a consistent UI)
6. Lombok (to get rid of boiler-plate code)
7. Maven
8. jUnit 4
9. H2 in-memory database (just for testing)

There are three roles in application - customer, manager and admin.

Responsibility of **Admin** is to toggle management status of users.
It can be accomplished at _/admin_ endpoint, that 
permits only requests from one IP address, 
mentioned at security.properties file.

**Manager** can view all the customers, and their orders 
as well as adding new hotels and attach rooms to them.

**Customer** can book view the hotels and book rooms in a certain room, that is not busy at mentioned period.

Instruction:
1. In a root package of the project there is a file **_init.sql_**.
It is an SQL script that creates schema pictured below.

**Database schema visualisation:**

2. In the resources package you will see _db_example.properties_ file. 
It's an example of **_db.properties_** file that _must_ be created in the same package.

3. Just for convenience I have added TestDBConnection class, that expects JDBC url, username and password to verify connection.

4. If you wish, you can execute data.sql script as well to prepopulate roles and countries in a database.

Application has been successfully run and manually tested using **_Tomcat server_**.
